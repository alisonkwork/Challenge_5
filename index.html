      <p>Running is a great way to get outside, stay active, and increase your overall health. Whether you’re running for fun or competing in races, check out some of these tips to become a stronger, less injury-prone runner. </p>

      <h3>Mentality</h3>
      <p>Running has amazing benefits to your mood and overall mental health, but getting out there and pushing yourself takes a lot of discipline. If you’re struggling to get started, simply putting on your running shoes and going outside can give you the motivation to keep going.</p>
      
      <blockquote>As my cross country coach used to say, “you’re here, so you may as well get better.”</blockquote>
      
      <p>Joining a team or a running club for outside accountability can help a lot as well. </p>

      <h3>Mileage</h3>
      <p>If you’re just starting out or have taken a long break, it’s extremely important to slowly build up mileage. For the first few weeks, you can run every other day, or alternate walking and running. Try not to increase your weekly mileage too quickly – a good rule of thumb is increasing by 2-5 miles every week. When you’ve built up a solid base and are running consistently, listen to your body and know your limits. If you have a few high mileage weeks in a row, take a week to lower the mileage so your body can rest and you don’t over-do it.</p>
      <h3>Workouts</h3>
      <p>If you’re interested in increasing your speed and endurance, workouts are important to include in your training plan.</p>
      <p>For speed workouts, some examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>200 meter repeats on a track</li>
        <li>10 sets of 1 minute hard followed by 1 minute rest</li>
        <li>Hill sprints</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For endurance workouts, some examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Tempo runs, such as 10 - 15 minutes of uptempo in the middle of your regular run</li>
        <li>1 mile repeats</li>
        <li>Fartleks, such as running hard for 5 minutes, 4 minutes, 3 minutes, 2 minutes, and 1 minute with a 1 minute rest in between</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When you’re running “uptempo”, that means that you can still talk to the person next to you, but it isn’t comfortable to say more than a few words.</p>
      <h3>Strength and Cross Training</h3>
      <p>Another tip to improve your speed and reduce the chances of injury is to include both strength training and cross training. For strength training, all you need are some dumbbells, or even just your body weight. Incorporating core exercises is important as well – planks are a great way to strengthen your core! For cross training, try biking or swimming in place of running. It’s good to reduce the impact on your legs every now and again.</p>
      <h3>The “Little Things”</h3>
      <p>My coach always emphasized the importance of “the little things”. By this, he meant properly warming up before running and stretching after your run. He also meant drinking plenty of water throughout the day, eating enough protein, fruit, and vegetables, and most importantly, getting at least 8 hours of sleep. Paying attention to these “little things” make a huge impact in the long run and will help you feel better overall.</p>
